Traversing the "happy path" of the IT for IT reference architecture involves a number of documents and data objects that evolve as they move through the stages of planning, building, deploying, and running. Here's a high-level overview of how these documents transform and flow through the process:

**Planning Stage (Strategy to Portfolio - S2P):**

1. **Feature Requests:**
   - Individual suggestions or ideas for new features or improvements.

2. **Business Case:**
   - A collection of feature requests that align with business goals can lead to the formation of a business case. The business case includes analysis of benefits, costs, risks, and alignment with strategic objectives.

3. **Service Portfolio:**
   - Approved business cases are added to the service portfolio, which outlines the services to be developed or improved, with timelines and resource allocations.

**Building Stage (Requirement to Deploy - R2D):**

4. **Requirements Document:**
   - The business case transitions into a requirements document, which captures detailed functional and non-functional requirements that the IT service needs to meet.

5. **Design Specifications:**
   - Design teams translate requirements documents into technical specifications and design documents, which outline the architecture and design of the solution.

**Deploying Stage (Requirement to Deploy - R2D):**

6. **Themes, Epics, Stories, and Tasks:**
   - Requirements and design documents are further broken down into themes (high-level focus areas), epics (large bodies of work), user stories (features described from an end-user perspective), and tasks (specific work items).
   - This breakdown is often managed in a tool like JIRA or Azure DevOps.

7. **Deployment Plan:**
   - A detailed plan that outlines how software will be released into the production environment, including timelines, resources, and rollback procedures.

8. **Release Notes:**
   - A document that accompanies a software release and details the new features, improvements, bug fixes, and any configuration changes or requirements.

**Running Stage (Detect to Correct - D2C):**

9. **Operational Documentation:**
   - This includes runbooks, operational level agreements (OLAs), and any other documentation required for the management of the service.

10. **Service Catalog Entry:**
   - Once deployed, the IT service is listed in the service catalog with details on service levels, user guides, and support procedures.

11. **Monitoring and Feedback Tools:**
    - Tools and systems are set up to gather continuous feedback and monitor the service. This might involve analytics platforms, user surveys, or monitoring software.

**Throughout the Lifecycle:**

12. **Change Requests:**
    - If modifications are needed, change requests are created. These documents capture the necessary changes to features, design, or other aspects of the IT service.

13. **Project Management Artifacts:**
    - These include project plans, meeting minutes, status reports, and other documentation that supports the project management process.

14. **Quality Assurance and Test Plans:**
    - Detailed plans that describe the testing strategies, test cases, and standards for quality assurance throughout the development process.

15. **Training Materials:**
    - Documentation created to facilitate training for end-users and support teams on the new or updated IT service.

Each document is critical in ensuring that information is accurately communicated and that the project progresses smoothly from one stage to the next. In practice, these documents are often managed through an integrated set of tools that support collaboration, version control, and traceability across the entire lifecycle.

Hereâ€™s an inventory of key documents and artifacts typically used in IT project management, along with their titles and short descriptions:

1. **Feature Request Form**
   - A document used to capture individual suggestions or ideas for new features or improvements from stakeholders or customers.

2. **Business Case**
   - A strategic document that outlines the justification for undertaking a project, including benefits, costs, risks, and alignment with business goals.

3. **Service Portfolio**
   - A comprehensive list of IT services in various stages of their lifecycle managed by an organization, including those planned or under development.

4. **Requirements Document**
   - This details the functional and non-functional requirements that the product or service must satisfy.

5. **Design Specifications**
   - Technical documents that outline the system architecture, data models, interfaces, and other design elements of the solution.

6. **Themes and Epics**
   - High-level focus areas and large bodies of work that group together related user stories in the development process.

7. **User Stories and Tasks**
   - Descriptions of software features from an end-user perspective (user stories) and specific work items (tasks) needed to implement these features.

8. **Deployment Plan**
   - A detailed outline of how a software solution will be transitioned into the production environment.

9. **Release Notes**
   - Documentation that provides information on new features, bug fixes, and known issues with a software release.

10. **Operational Documentation**
    - Manuals and guides required for the day-to-day operation of a service, including runbooks and OLAs.

11. **Service Catalog Entry**
    - An official listing of a service in the organization's service catalog, detailing service descriptions, availability, and support information.

12. **Monitoring and Feedback Reports**
    - Reports from systems and tools used to monitor the service's performance and collect user feedback.

13. **Change Request Form**
    - A form used to request changes to the IT service or project, detailing the proposed changes and their impact.

14. **Project Management Plan**
    - A formal, approved document that defines how the project is executed, monitored, and controlled.

15. **Status Reports**
    - Regular updates provided to stakeholders detailing the progress, risks, and issues of the project.

16. **Quality Assurance Plan**
    - A document that outlines the planned quality assurance activities, testing processes, and standards for the project.

17. **Test Cases/Scenarios**
    - Specific instances to test to ensure the software meets the requirements, often with steps to execute, expected results, and actual results.

18. **Training Materials**
    - Guides, manuals, and other instructional documents used to train users and support teams on the new or updated IT service.

19. **Risk Management Plan**
    - Identifies potential risks to the project and outlines strategies for managing and mitigating these risks.

20. **Stakeholder Register**
    - A document listing all stakeholders, their interest, influence, and impact on the project.

21. **Communication Plan**
    - Describes the communication strategies, channels, frequency, and methods to engage stakeholders throughout the project.

22. **Resource Allocation Chart**
    - A breakdown of resources assigned to the project, including human resources, technology, and materials.

23. **Budget Document**
    - A detailed financial plan for the project, outlining all expected costs and revenue streams.

24. **Compliance Documentation**
    - Documentation ensuring that the project adheres to relevant laws, regulations, and policies.

25. **Architecture Review Records**
    - Assessments of the project's architecture to ensure it meets predefined standards and is aligned with the organization's technology strategy.

These documents are integral to the project lifecycle, from conception through delivery and maintenance, and serve as a guide to ensure that all project activities are aligned with the defined objectives and are transparent to stakeholders.
