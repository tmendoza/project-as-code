## Generating User Stories
In an agile and lean process, user stories are a concise and focused way to capture product requirements from the end-user's perspective. A good user story structure typically follows the "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [benefit]" format. To enhance this structure for comprehensiveness while maintaining leanness, we can include Acceptance Criteria and any relevant notes that provide additional context or requirements.

Here is an example of a comprehensive yet streamlined User Story structure for our scenario:

```markdown
# User Story Structure

**Title:** [Short descriptive title for the user story]

**As a** [type of user],
**I want** [action or feature],
**So that** [benefit or value].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** [some context],
- **When** [some action is carried out],
- **Then** [a set of observable outcomes should occur].

**Notes:**
- [Any additional information, constraints, or assumptions relevant to the story]

---

## Discussion on Quality Attributes
Quality Attributes, often referred to as Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs), define how a system should behave and encompass the qualities of a system that are not directly related to the functionality of the system. They represent the criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors or functions. In essence, while functional requirements describe what a system should do, quality attributes describe how the system should do it.

In the context of a requirements document, quality attributes outline the expected standards of system performance and provide a framework for evaluating the system's acceptability for use. They are crucial for ensuring the system meets the user's expectations and the organization's operational standards.

Here are some common categories and examples of quality attributes:

1. **Performance:** The system's response time, throughput, and resource utilization under a particular workload.
2. **Reliability:** The system's ability to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period.
3. **Usability:** How easy and intuitive the system is to use, including user interface design and user experience aspects.
4. **Efficiency:** Resource usage relative to the performance of the system.
5. **Maintainability:** How easy it is to maintain, modify, and enhance the system.
6. **Portability:** The ability of the system to work under different operating systems, in different environments, or when interchanging components.
7. **Scalability:** The system's capacity to accommodate growth, such as an increase in users, data volume, or transaction counts, without performance degradation.
8. **Security:** The system's ability to protect data against unauthorized access and ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
9. **Availability:** The proportion of time that the system is operational and accessible when required for use.
10. **Recoverability:** The system's ability to recover from faults and resume processing within a certain time and with no or minimal data loss.
11. **Testability:** How easily the system can be tested to ensure it functions correctly and meets its designed requirements.
12. **Interoperability:** The system's ability to interact with other systems or components.
13. **Compliance:** The system's adherence to laws, regulations, standards, and guidelines applicable to the industry and technology.

Quality attributes are often captured as part of the architectural and design considerations of the system and are used to guide the choice of technologies, frameworks, and design patterns. They are crucial for delivering a system that not only meets the user's functional needs but also provides a reliable, secure, and efficient user experience.

## Write up a questionnaire which interrogates the submitter with the intent of gathering all of the relevant data needs to flesh out the "Quality Attributes"
To gather the necessary data for defining the quality attributes of an IT system, a questionnaire should be designed to interrogate the submitter on various aspects of system performance, usability, reliability, and other non-functional requirements. Here's an example of such a questionnaire:
