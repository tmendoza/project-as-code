Each non-functional requirement will typically have specific metrics and testing procedures associated with it to ensure compliance and effectiveness. These NFRs are critical to the overall success and user adoption of IT service platforms.

## Generating User Stories
In an agile and lean process, user stories are a concise and focused way to capture product requirements from the end-user's perspective. A good user story structure typically follows the "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [benefit]" format. To enhance this structure for comprehensiveness while maintaining leanness, we can include Acceptance Criteria and any relevant notes that provide additional context or requirements.

Here is an example of a comprehensive yet streamlined User Story structure for our scenario:

```markdown
# User Story Structure

**Title:** [Short descriptive title for the user story]

**As a** [type of user],
**I want** [action or feature],
**So that** [benefit or value].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** [some context],
- **When** [some action is carried out],
- **Then** [a set of observable outcomes should occur].

**Notes:**
- [Any additional information, constraints, or assumptions relevant to the story]

---

# Example User Stories

## User Story 1: Basic Search Functionality

**Title:** Implement Basic Search

**As a** support agent,
**I want** to quickly search for tickets using keywords,
**So that** I can efficiently respond to customer queries.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** the support agent is logged into the system,
- **When** they enter keywords related to a ticket in the search bar,
- **Then** the system should display a list of tickets that match the keywords within 2 seconds.

**Notes:**
- Search results should be ordered by relevance.
- The search should include ticket titles, descriptions, and comments.

## User Story 2: Advanced Search Filters

**Title:** Implement Advanced Search Filters

**As a** support agent,
**I want** to filter search results by date, status, and customer ID,
**So that** I can find specific sets of tickets quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** the support agent has a list of search results,
- **When** they apply filters for date range, status, and customer ID,
- **Then** the system should display only the tickets that meet all of the selected criteria.

**Notes:**
- The system should allow multiple filters to be applied simultaneously.
- Filters should be easily accessible from the search interface.

## User Story 3: Search Query Saving

**Title:** Save Frequent Search Queries

**As a** support manager,
**I want** to save frequent search queries,
**So that** I can reuse them without re-entering the search criteria each time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** the support manager has executed a search with specific criteria,
- **When** they choose to save the search query,
- **Then** the system should allow them to name and save the query for future use.

**Notes:**
- Saved searches should be accessible from the user's dashboard.
- Users should have the option to edit and delete saved searches.

```

This user story structure is designed to guide the development team through the implementation of the feature request, ensuring that the end product aligns with the user's needs and the business objectives. Including Acceptance Criteria and notes ensures that each story is testable and provides enough context to be actionable without being overly prescriptive, allowing room for innovation and adaptation within the agile development process.

## Data Requirements
Data requirements are essential to understanding what data the system needs to handle, how it should be processed, and how it will be maintained. In our example of implementing an advanced search functionality in a Java application ticketing system, the data requirements could be detailed as follows:

```markdown

```

These data requirements are designed to guide the development team on how to handle the data aspects of the advanced search functionality, ensuring that the end product is robust, reliable, secure, and provides a high-quality user experience. Each requirement would be further fleshed out during the design and development process to ensure comprehensive coverage of all data-related needs.
