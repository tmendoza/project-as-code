# Components under Discussion

## Overall Structure and Components
Based on our discussions and the established feature request and business case example, the requirements document should be structured to clearly outline the specifications for the advanced search functionality in the Java application. The document will serve as a guide for the development team to understand what needs to be built.

Here's a structured approach for the requirements document:
