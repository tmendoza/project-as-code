# IT Project Management Documentation Framework

## Overview

This framework leverages the "Documentation as Code" methodology, applying the principles of version control and collaboration to the creation and maintenance of IT project management documentation. This README outlines the setup and structure of a Git repository designed to house and track various project-related documents.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories reflecting the different types of documents:

/feature-requests
/business-cases
/service-portfolio
/requirements
/design-specifications
/agile-artifacts
/deployment
/operations
/monitoring-feedback
/project-management
/quality-assurance
/training-materials
/risk-compliance

## Documentation Practices

### Markdown Files

- All documents are written in Markdown (.md) to ensure readability and ease of editing within the Git repository.

### Automated Documentation Generation

- Tools like Sphinx, MkDocs, or Jekyll are used to convert Markdown files into a user-friendly documentation website.

### Branching Strategy

- A branching strategy is implemented to parallel the development process, utilizing feature branches for changes that are reviewed via pull requests.

### Review Process

- Documentation changes undergo peer review through pull requests, similar to code reviews.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- CI/CD pipelines validate Markdown files, ensuring no broken links or formatting issues.

### Issue Tracking

- The repository's issue tracker manages documentation updates and improvements.

### Tagging and Releases

- Documentation versions are tagged and released, corresponding with major project milestones or software version releases.

### Accessibility

- The repository is designed to be editable by non-developers, with a user-friendly interface for contributing documentation.

### Templates and Checklists

- Standardized templates and checklists are provided to ensure consistency and completeness across documents.

### Linking Artifacts

- Documents are interlinked where applicable, connecting feature requests, user stories, test cases, and release notes.

### Versioned Documentation

- Multiple versions of documentation are maintained when necessary to support software with multiple active versions.

### Access Control

- Git's access control mechanisms manage permissions for contributing to the repository.

### Searchability

- The repository and the generated documentation site are fully searchable.

### Backup and Security

- Regular backups are conducted, and sensitive information is secured appropriately.

## Initial Setup

### Initialize a New Git Repository

- A new repository named `it-project-management-docs` is created on a platform like GitHub.

### Define the Directory Structure

- The repository is organized into directories that categorize the documents.

### Create Templates and Guidelines

- Markdown templates are created for each document type.
- Contribution guidelines are detailed in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Set Up Branching and Contribution Workflow

- A branching strategy is established along with a review process for merging changes.

## Maintenance and Continuous Improvement

### Populate the Repository

- Initial documents and templates are added to the respective directories.

### Implement Access Control

- Permissions are set for who can contribute directly or through pull requests.

### Automated Validation

- CI/CD pipelines are configured to validate documentation.

### Versioning and Release Management

- Semantic versioning and tagging are used for document releases.

### Integration with Project Management Tools

- The repository is integrated with tools like JIRA to link documentation to project tasks.

### Documentation Builds

- A static site generator is set up for documentation viewing.
- Webhooks are configured for automatic building and deploying upon updates.

### Search Functionality

- A search tool is included in the documentation site for easy navigation.

### Monitoring and Maintenance

- The repository is regularly reviewed and updated to keep the documentation current.

### Back Up the Repository

- Backups of the repository are performed regularly.

### Onboard Team Members

- Team members are trained on using the repository and contributing to the documentation.

This framework is intended to ensure that IT project documentation is as rigorously managed as the source code, providing a single source of truth that evolves with the project lifecycle.

This README file can be placed at the root of your Git repository to serve as a guide for contributors, detailing how to navigate and utilize the repository for project documentation.
