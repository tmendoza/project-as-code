# IT Documentation Generation Process

## Q: What should we call this process? (ADVICE)
Considering the comprehensive and structured nature of this process, which encompasses input gathering, analysis, standardization, and formal reporting, you could name it the **"Integrated Documentation Lifecycle Framework" (IDLF)**.

This name reflects:

- **Integrated:** The process is holistic and encompasses multiple stages of documentation development.
- **Documentation:** It's focused on creating and maintaining project documents.
- **Lifecycle:** It covers the entire lifespan of a document from initial idea capture to formal reporting.
- **Framework:** It provides a structured approach and set of tools for managing documentation.

The IDLF can be a cornerstone of project management, ensuring that knowledge is captured accurately and consistently, providing a clear pathway for decision-making and project progression.

## Advice
Absolutely, the approach you've outlined ensures that each stage of documentation is thorough, standardized, and conducive to analysis and decision-making. Here's how this can be implemented across the different document types:

1. **Input Forms (Questionnaires):**
   - Create a unique questionnaire for each type of document. These forms should be designed to capture all necessary information systematically. For example, a feature request form might include fields for the proposed feature's name, description, expected benefits, and priority level.

2. **Itemized Breakdowns:**
   - Once the questionnaire is completed, the responses are compiled into an itemized breakdown that categorizes and lists all the information provided. This breakdown is formatted for clarity and ease of understanding, ensuring that each response is associated with the relevant section of the document it will inform.

3. **Standardized Document Sections:**
   - Develop a template for each document type that includes predefined sections. For instance, a business case document might have sections for Executive Summary, Business Need, Market Analysis, Financial Projection, Risks and Mitigation, etc.

4. **Formal Report-Style Documents:**
   - Transform the itemized breakdowns into formal, polished documents. These reports will aggregate the collected information in a narrative that logically flows from problem statement to proposed solution, complete with analyses and appendices where necessary.

This process can be supported by tools and systems within the Git repository. For instance:

- **Template Files:** Store Markdown templates for questionnaires and reports in the respective directories.
- **Scripts and Tools:** Utilize scripts to help transform questionnaire responses into the breakdown and final report format.
- **Pull Requests and Reviews:** Use Git's pull request feature to facilitate peer review of the formal documents before they are finalized.
- **Version Tracking:** Leverage Git's version control to track changes to documents over time, maintaining a history of edits and updates.
- **Automation:** Implement CI/CD pipelines to check document formatting and consistency upon each commit.

By following this structured approach, you're ensuring that each document is created with a high level of detail and consistency, making it easier to understand the business problems and solutions at every stage of the project.

## Q: Lets map out this process in-depth this process? (ADVICE)
Certainly! Letâ€™s map out the **"Integrated Documentation Lifecycle Framework" (IDLF)** in a detailed manner:

### Stage 1: Information Capture

**Objective:** To collect all necessary information regarding a new idea, feature, or project requirement.

**Process:**

1. **Questionnaire Design:**
   - For each document type, a comprehensive questionnaire is crafted to elicit all required information. This includes clear instructions and prompts for users to provide detailed responses.
   - Example: A feature request questionnaire might ask for a description, business rationale, expected outcomes, and any preliminary ideas for implementation.

2. **Information Submission:**
   - Stakeholders complete the questionnaires. Responses are expected to be thoughtful and thorough, providing a solid foundation for the next steps.
   - Example: A product manager fills out the feature request form detailing customer needs and potential market impact.

### Stage 2: Itemized Structuring

**Objective:** To organize the raw data from questionnaires into a coherent and categorized format.

**Process:**

1. **Data Organization:**
   - Responses are extracted from the questionnaire and organized into an itemized list that mirrors the sections of the final document.
   - Example: Responses are sorted into categories such as 'Feature Description', 'Business Value', 'Technical Requirements', etc.

2. **Initial Review:**
   - The itemized list is reviewed for completeness and clarity. Any gaps in information prompt a follow-up with the respondent.
   - Example: A project analyst reviews the list and requests further details on certain technical requirements.

### Stage 3: Document Drafting

**Objective:** To draft a standardized document based on the organized information that outlines the project or feature in detail.

**Process:**

1. **Template Utilization:**
   - A pre-defined template corresponding to the document type is selected. The itemized information is populated into the relevant sections of this template.
   - Example: The itemized list for a business case is entered into a template that includes sections for Executive Summary, Financial Projections, and Risk Assessment.

2. **Draft Creation:**
   - A formal draft document is created, ensuring that the information flows logically and is presented professionally.
   - Example: A technical writer composes the draft of the business case, ensuring the narrative is compelling and justifies the feature's development.

### Stage 4: Peer Review and Collaboration

**Objective:** To refine the document through collaborative feedback and ensure its accuracy and completeness.

**Process:**

1. **Peer Review Initiation:**
   - The draft document is circulated amongst a peer group for review. Comments and suggestions are collected and considered.
   - Example: Other product managers and the development team review the business case draft, providing feedback on feasibility and market alignment.

2. **Document Revision:**
   - The document is revised according to feedback, with significant changes discussed and agreed upon.
   - Example: Based on feedback, the financial projections in the business case are adjusted to reflect a more conservative estimate.

### Stage 5: Formalization and Approval

**Objective:** To finalize the document and obtain necessary approvals for the project or feature to proceed.

**Process:**

1. **Final Edits and Formatting:**
   - The document undergoes final editing for language, formatting, and coherence. All sections are reviewed for alignment with the project goals.
   - Example: The business case is proofread, formatted according to company standards, and all diagrams and appendices are checked for accuracy.

2. **Approval Seeking:**
   - The completed document is presented to decision-makers for approval. This may include presentations or discussions to address any concerns.
   - Example: The product management team presents the business case to the executive board, addressing questions and highlighting the expected ROI.

### Stage 6: Documentation Management and Version Control

**Objective:** To maintain the document as a living artifact that evolves with the project.

**Process:**

1. **Version Control:**
   - The approved document is checked into the Git repository. Changes are tracked through commits, with version tagging used for major updates.
   - Example: The business case is committed to the repository with a version tag corresponding to the project phase.

2. **Continuous Updates:**
   - As the project progresses, the document is updated to reflect changes, with each iteration going through the review and approval process.
   - Example: As development uncovers new information, the business case is updated, reviewed, and re-approved to reflect the latest understanding.

By meticulously detailing each stage and the expected outcomes, the IDLF emphasizes the importance of thoroughness, collaboration, and adaptability in managing project documentation. The framework ensures that documents are not static but evolve with the project, maintaining relevance and accuracy from inception to completion.
