# IT Documentation Generation Process

## Q: What should we call this process? (ADVICE)
Considering the comprehensive and structured nature of this process, which encompasses input gathering, analysis, standardization, and formal reporting, you could name it the **"Integrated Documentation Lifecycle Framework" (IDLF)**.

This name reflects:

- **Integrated:** The process is holistic and encompasses multiple stages of documentation development.
- **Documentation:** It's focused on creating and maintaining project documents.
- **Lifecycle:** It covers the entire lifespan of a document from initial idea capture to formal reporting.
- **Framework:** It provides a structured approach and set of tools for managing documentation.

The IDLF can be a cornerstone of project management, ensuring that knowledge is captured accurately and consistently, providing a clear pathway for decision-making and project progression.

## Advice
Absolutely, the approach you've outlined ensures that each stage of documentation is thorough, standardized, and conducive to analysis and decision-making. Here's how this can be implemented across the different document types:

1. **Input Forms (Questionnaires):**
   - Create a unique questionnaire for each type of document. These forms should be designed to capture all necessary information systematically. For example, a feature request form might include fields for the proposed feature's name, description, expected benefits, and priority level.

2. **Itemized Breakdowns:**
   - Once the questionnaire is completed, the responses are compiled into an itemized breakdown that categorizes and lists all the information provided. This breakdown is formatted for clarity and ease of understanding, ensuring that each response is associated with the relevant section of the document it will inform.

3. **Standardized Document Sections:**
   - Develop a template for each document type that includes predefined sections. For instance, a business case document might have sections for Executive Summary, Business Need, Market Analysis, Financial Projection, Risks and Mitigation, etc.

4. **Formal Report-Style Documents:**
   - Transform the itemized breakdowns into formal, polished documents. These reports will aggregate the collected information in a narrative that logically flows from problem statement to proposed solution, complete with analyses and appendices where necessary.

This process can be supported by tools and systems within the Git repository. For instance:

- **Template Files:** Store Markdown templates for questionnaires and reports in the respective directories.
- **Scripts and Tools:** Utilize scripts to help transform questionnaire responses into the breakdown and final report format.
- **Pull Requests and Reviews:** Use Git's pull request feature to facilitate peer review of the formal documents before they are finalized.
- **Version Tracking:** Leverage Git's version control to track changes to documents over time, maintaining a history of edits and updates.
- **Automation:** Implement CI/CD pipelines to check document formatting and consistency upon each commit.

By following this structured approach, you're ensuring that each document is created with a high level of detail and consistency, making it easier to understand the business problems and solutions at every stage of the project.
